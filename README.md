# TravelMate
TravelMate, a travel website made with Bootstrap CSS (https://https://alfathmuqoddas.github.io/travelmate)

## About This Project
A simple travel website made with Bootstrap CSS. I made this project to sharpen my skills in replicating the design wireframe, to translate the markup design into working code. 

## Technology Used
HTML5, Vanilla CSS, [BootstrapCSS](https://getbootstrap.com), [FlicktityJS](https://flickity.metafizzy.co)

## Challenge
The challege I face when making this project is to make the slider of quotes section in the pages, making one from vanilla JavaScript would take much time for a simple section of page, then I'm using FlickityJS a JavaScript library to make a slider fast and easy
